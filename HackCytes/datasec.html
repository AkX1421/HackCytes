                            Data security describes the protection of digital data from a cyberattack or a data breach.
                            A data breach is the unauthorized opening of data, typically to read or copy the
                            information.
                            Stolen data may contain confidential information, such as customer data, credit card
                            numbers, or trade secrets. A cyberattack is much more aggressive.
                            It is an effort by hackers to cripple or destroy a computer system or network.

                        </p>


                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> Here is an example −<br>
                            For example, a few years ago, hackers attacked a petrochemical plant located in Saudi
                            Arabia, and gained control of a critical safety shut-off system used for catastrophic
                            events.
                            Malicious software, called Triton or Trisis, was used, which can run unapproved programs.
                            The malware can also scan and map the control system, providing reconnaissance and issuing
                            commands.
                            Once this type of malware (called a RAT or Remotely Accessible Trojan), has invaded a
                            system, it takes control by way of a remote network connection.
                            This presents a new phase in attacks on the control-systems of utilities, chemical plants,
                            and factories.

                        Data security is the practice of protecting digital information from unauthorized access,
                        corruption, or theft throughout its entire lifecycle.
                        It’s a concept that encompasses every aspect of information security from the physical security
                        of hardware and storage devices to administrative and access controls, as well as the logical
                        security of software applications.
                        It also includes organizational policies and procedures.
                        When properly implemented, robust data security strategies will protect an organization’s
                        information assets against cybercriminal activities, but they also guard against insider threats
                        and human error, which remains among the leading causes of data breaches today.
                        Data security involves deploying tools and technologies that enhance the organization’s
                        visibility into where its critical data resides and how it is used. Ideally, these tools should
                        be able to apply protections like encryption, data masking, and redaction of sensitive files,
                        and should automate reporting to streamline audits and adhering to regulatory requirements.

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Encryption −
                            Using an algorithm to transform normal text characters into an unreadable format, encryption
                            keys scramble data so that only authorized users can read it.  File and database encryption
                            solutions serve as a final line of defense for sensitive volumes by obscuring their contents
                            through encryption or tokenization. Most solutions also include security key management
                            capabilities.

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Data Erasure −
                            More secure than standard data wiping, data erasure uses software to completely overwrite
                            data on any storage device. It verifies that the data is unrecoverable.
                        </li>

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Data Masking −
                            By masking data, organizations can allow teams to develop applications or train people using
                            real data. It masks personally identifiable information (PII) where necessary so that
                            development can occur in environments that are compliant.</li>

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Data Resiliency −
                            Resiliency is determined by how well an organization endures or recovers from any type of
                            failure – from hardware problems to power shortages and other events that affect data
                            availability (PDF, 256 KB). Speed of recovery is critical to minimize impact.

                        A comprehensive data security strategy incorporates people, processes, and technologies.
                        Establishing appropriate controls and policies is as much a question of organizational culture
                        as it is of deploying the right tool set. This means making information security a priority
                        across all areas of the enterprise.

                            Regardless of whether your data is stored on-premises, in a corporate data center, or in the
                            public cloud, you need to ensure that facilities are secured against intruders and have
                            adequate fire suppression measures and climate controls in place. A cloud provider will
                            assume responsibility for these protective measures on your behalf.

                        </li>

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Access management and controls −
                            The principle of “least-privilege access” should be followed throughout your entire IT
                            environment. This means granting database, network, and administrative account access to as
                            few people as possible, and only those who absolutely need it to get their jobs done.
                        </li>

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Application security and patching −
                            All software should be updated to the latest version as soon as possible after patches or
                            new versions are released.

                            Maintaining usable, thoroughly tested backup copies of all critical data is a core component
                            of any robust data security strategy. In addition, all backups should be subject to the same
                            physical and logical security controls that govern access to the primary databases and core
                            systems.

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Employee education −
                            Training employees in the importance of good security practices and password hygiene and
                            teaching them to recognize social engineering attacks transforms them into a “human
                            firewall” that can play a critical role in safeguarding your data.

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Network and endpoint security monitoring and controls -
                            Implementing a comprehensive suite of threat management, detection, and response tools and
                            platforms across your on-premises environment and cloud platforms can mitigate risks and
                            reduce the probability of a breach.

                            AI amplifies the ability of a data security system because it can process large amounts of
                            data. Cognitive Computing, a subset of AI, performs the same tasks as other AI systems but
                            it does so by simulating human thought processes. In data security, this allows for rapid
                            decision-making in times of critical need.

                        </li>

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Multi-cloud security −
                            The definition of data security has expanded as cloud capabilities grow. Now organizations
                            need more complex solutions as they seek protection for not only data, but applications and

                            A revolutionary technology, quantum promises to upend many traditional technologies
                            exponentially. Encryption algorithms will become much more faceted, increasingly complex and
                            much more secure.

                            Computer viruses are pieces of software that are designed to be spread from one computer to
                            another. They’re often sent as email attachments or downloaded from specific websites with
                            the intent to infect your computer — and other computers on your contact list — by using
                            systems on your network. Viruses are known to send spam, disable your security settings,
                            corrupt and steal data from your computer including personal information such as passwords,
                            even going as far as to delete everything on your hard drive.

                            Rogue security software is malicious software that mislead users to believe that they have
                            network security issues, most commonly a computer virus installed on their computer or that
                            their security measures are not up to date. Then they offer to install or update users’
                            security settings. They’ll either ask you to download their program to remove the alleged
                            viruses, or to pay for a tool. Both cases lead to actual malware being installed on your
                            computer.

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Trojan Horse −
                            Metaphorically, a “Trojan horse” refers to tricking someone into inviting an attacker into a
                            securely protected area. In computing, it holds a very similar meaning — a Trojan horse, or
                            “Trojan,” is a malicious bit of attacking code or software that tricks users into running it
                            willingly, by hiding behind a legitimate program.
                            They spread often by email; it may appear as an email from someone you know, and when you
                            click on the email and its included attachment, you’ve immediately downloaded malware to
                            your computer. Trojans also spread when you click on a false advertisement.
                            Once inside your computer, a Trojan horse can record your passwords by logging keystrokes,
                            hijacking your webcam, and stealing any sensitive data you may have on your computer.

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Adware and Spyware −
                            By “adware” we consider any software that is designed to track data of your browsing habits
                            and, based on that, show you advertisements and pop-ups. Adware collects data with your
                            consent — and is even a legitimate source of income for companies that allow users to try
                            their software for free, but with advertisements showing while using the software. The
                            adware clause is often hidden in related User Agreement docs, but it can be checked by
                            carefully reading anything you accept while installing software. The presence of adware on
                            your computer is noticeable only in those pop-ups, and sometimes it can slow down your
                            computer’s processor and internet connection speed.
                            When adware is downloaded without consent, it is considered malicious.
                            Spyware works similarly to adware, but is installed on your computer without your knowledge.
                            It can contain keyloggers that record personal information including email addresses,
                            passwords, even credit card numbers, making it dangerous because of the high risk of
                            identity theft.

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Computer Worm −
                            Computer worms are pieces of malware programs that replicate quickly and spread from one
                            computer to another. A worm spreads from an infected computer by sending itself to all of
                            the computer’s contacts, then immediately to the contacts of the other computers.

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">DOS and DDOS attack -
                            A DoS attack is performed by one machine and its internet connection, by flooding a website
                            with packets and making it impossible for legitimate users to access the content of flooded
                            website. Fortunately, you can’t really overload a server with a single other server or a PC
                            anymore. In the past years it hasn’t been that common if anything, then by flaws in the
                            protocol.
                            A DDoS attack, or distributed denial-of-service attack, is similar to DoS, but is more
                            forceful. It’s harder to overcome a DDoS attack. It’s launched from several computers, and
                            the number of computers involved can range from just a couple of them to thousands or even
                            more.

                        <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Phishing -
                            Phishing is a method of a social engineering with the goal of obtaining sensitive data such
                            as passwords, usernames, credit card numbers.
                            The attacks often come in the form of instant messages or phishing emails designed to appear
                            legitimate. The recipient of the email is then tricked into opening a malicious link, which
                            leads to the installation of malware on the recipient’s computer.
