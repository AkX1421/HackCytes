                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"><b>What is XSS?</b></p>

                    <p class="w3-medium w3-text-dark-grey">Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability in a web
                        application that allows injects malicious code into the vulnerable web application. The
                        exploitation of XSS against a user can lead to various consequences such as account compromise,
                        account deletion, privilege escalation, malware infection and many more.

                        Cross site scripting attacks can be broken down into two types: stored and reflected.</p>


                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"><b>Types of XSS?</b></p>
                    <h3 class="w3-text-dark-grey">✔️ Stored XSS: </h3>
                    <p class="w3-medium w3-text-dark-grey">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stored XSS, also known as persistent XSS, is the
                        more damaging of the two. It occurs when a malicious script is injected directly into a
                        vulnerable web application.</p>

                    <div style="background-color:#00083D;padding:20px;">
                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <span
                                style="color:#e08b3e">https://web-app.com/status?message=&#60;script>/*+malicious+code...+*/&#60;/script>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                            <br>
                            <span style="color:#72bcd4">&#60;script>/*+malicious+code...+*/&#60;/script></span>
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="w3-medium w3-text-dark-grey">&nbsp;&nbsp;When a user visits the page, the attacker’s
                        script executes, and the script now has access to any action or data that the user can access.
                    </p>

                    <div style="background-color:#00083D;padding:20px;">
                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <span
                                style="color:#72bcd4">&#8249;&#60;script>alert(document.cookie)&#60;/script>&#8250;</span>
                        </p>

                        <p class="w3-medium">It will be saved in the database and executed on the page load, as the
                            latest user opinion will be displayed on the page. If a website is vulnerable to XSS, then
                            the page load popup window with cookies will be displayed. This script is quite simple and
                            less harmful. However, instead of this script, a more harmful code may be entered.</p>

                        <h3 class="w3-text-dark-grey">✔️ Reflected XSS: </h3>

                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Reflected XSS involves the reflecting of a malicious
                            script from a web application, onto a user’s browser. The script is embedded into a link and
                            is only activated once that link is clicked on.</p>

                        <h3 class="w3-text-dark-grey">✔️ DOM-Based XSS: </h3>
                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">DOM-based cross-site scripting (client-side XSS) has some
                            similarity to reflected XSS as damaging script is often delivered through a malicious URL.
                            However, rather than including the payload in the HTTP response of a trusted site, the
                            attack is executed entirely in the browser by modifying the DOM or Document Object Model.
                            This targets the failure of legitimate JavaScript already on the page to properly sanitize
                            user
                            input.http://testing.com/book.html?default=&#60;script>alert(document.cookie)&#60;/script>

                            In this Example, the request is sent for the page
                            book.html?default=&#60;script>alert(document.cookie)&#60;/script> to testing.com. Therefore,
                            for that page, a DOM object is being created by the browser, where the document location
                            object will contain the appropriate string.
                        </p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">SQL injection is a type of cyber attack that involves injecting malicious code into an application's Structured Query Language (SQL) database. SQL is a programming language that is used to manage and manipulate data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). </p>
                    
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">In a SQL injection attack, an attacker injects malicious code into an application's SQL database by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's input validation processes. This code is then executed by the database, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database and potentially steal or manipulate data.</p>
                                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">SQL statements by the attacker are designed so that they can
                        be executed while the webserver is fetching content from the application server. It compromises
                        the security of a web application.<br>
                        Example:<br>
                        12222345 or 1=1.
                    </p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">So, this basically translates to:<br>

                        SELECT * from STUDENT where <br>
                        STUDENT-ID == 12222345 or 1 = 1 <br>
                        Now this 1=1 will return all records for which this holds true. So basically, all the student
                        data is compromised. Now the malicious user can also delete the student records in a similar
                        fashion.

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Authentication bypass is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker is able to gain access to a system or application without providing the correct credentials. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process or by using techniques such as brute force attacks or password cracking.
                    </p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> There are several ways that an attacker might attempt to bypass authentication, such as:</p>
                    1️⃣ <b>Guessing or cracking passwords </b><br> An attacker might try to guess or crack a user's password in order to gain access to a system or application.

                    <br>
                    2️⃣ <b>Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process:  </b><br> An attacker might look for vulnerabilities in the way that an application or system handles authentication, such as weak passwords or unsecured login pages, and exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">An OTP bypass attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker is able to gain access to a system or application by bypassing the OTP authentication process. This can be done by intercepting the OTP as it is being transmitted, using a stolen or compromised OTP, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the OTP authentication process.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">To prevent OTP bypass attacks, it is important to implement strong OTP authentication measures, such as using secure communication channels to transmit OTPs and regularly updating and patching systems and applications to fix any vulnerabilities. It is also important to educate users on the importance of keeping their OTPs secure and not sharing them with unauthorized parties.

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Rate limiting is a process to limit requests possible. It is
                        used to control network traffic. Suppose a web server allows up to 20 requests per minute. If
                        you try to send more than 20 requests, an error will be triggered. This is necessary to prevent
                        the attackers from sending excessive requests to the server.
                        No rate limit is a flaw that doesn’t limit the no. of attempts one makes on a website server to
                        extract data. It is a vulnerability which can prove to be critical when misused by attackers.

                    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">&#8594; USES OF RATE LIMITING FEATURE:</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">1️⃣ Reduces excessive load on web servers</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">2️⃣ Prevent DOS (denial of service) attack</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">3️⃣ Help stop certain kinds of malicious bot activity like
                        login to an account using multiple guess password and user id</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">4️⃣ Also prevent brute-force attacks</p>


                    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">&#8594;How does rate limit work?</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Rate limiting runs within an application, rather than running
                        on the web server itself. Typically, rate limiting is based on tracking the IP addresses that
                        requests are coming from and tracking how much time elapses between each request. The IP address
                        is the main way an application identifies who or what is making the request.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">A rate limiting solution measures the amount of time between
                        each request from each IP address and measures the number of requests within a specified
                        timeframe. If there are too many requests from a single IP within the given timeframe, the rate
                        limiting solution will not fulfil the IP address's requests for a certain amount of time.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Essentially, a rate-limited application will say, "Hey, slow
                        down," to unique users that are making requests at a rapid rate. This is comparable to a police
                        officer who pulls over a driver for exceeding the road's speed limit, or to a parent who tells
                        their child not to eat so much candy in such a short span of time.</p>
                    Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations.

                        security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they
                        do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy,
                        which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.


                        For a CSRF attack to be possible, three key conditions must be in place:</p>

                        &#8594;A relevant action. There is an action within the application that the attacker has a
                        reason to induce. This might be a privileged action (such as modifying permissions for other
                        users) or any action on user-specific data (such as changing the user's own password).

                        involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application relies solely on session
                        cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place
                        for tracking sessions or validating user requests.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Once the malicious HTML code has been injected, it can be used to modify the website or application in various ways, such as redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing sensitive information, or altering the website's content or appearance. HTML injection attacks can be used to launch other types of attacks, such as phishing attacks or malware infections.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">To prevent HTML injection attacks, it is important to implement strong input validation measures and secure forms and input fields. Regular testing and patching of websites and applications can also help to identify and address any vulnerabilities that may be exploited by attackers. It is also important for users to be cautious when visiting websites and to be aware of any suspicious or unexpected changes to a website's content or appearance.</p>

                        page, the attacker has loaded an iframe with your mail account and lined up exactly the
                        “delete all messages” button directly on top of the “free iPod” button. The victim tries to

                        The $_GET is one of the sets of instruction which will get a particular file or webpage from
                        a web server i.e. it will request for a file. The ['page'] is an argument that will define
                        what type of pages will be displayed in response.
