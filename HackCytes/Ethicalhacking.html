                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Hacking has been a part of computing for almost five
                            decades and it is a very broad discipline, which covers a wide range of topics. We can
                            segregate hacking into different categories, based on what is being hacked.</p>


                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> Here is a set of examples −</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Website Hacking − Hacking a website means taking unauthorized
                                control over a web server and its associated software such as databases and other
                                interfaces.</li>

                            <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Network Hacking − Hacking a network means gathering
                                information about a network by using tools like Telnet, NS lookup, Ping, Tracert,
                                Netstat, etc. with the intent to harm the network system and hamper its operation.</li>

                            <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Email Hacking − It includes getting unauthorized access on an
                                Email account and using it without taking the consent of its owner.</li>

                            <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Ethical Hacking − Ethical hacking involves finding weaknesses
                                in a computer or network system for testing purpose and finally getting them fixed.</li>

                            <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Password Hacking − This is the process of recovering secret
                                passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.</li>

                            <li class="w3-text-dark-grey">Computer Hacking − This is the process of stealing computer ID
                                and password by applying hacking methods and getting unauthorized access to a computer
                                system.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> 1️⃣ <b>White Hat Hackers</b></p>
                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">White Hat hackers are also known as Ethical Hackers. They
                            are never intent to harm a system, rather they try to find out weaknesses in a computer or a
                            network system as a part of penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.Ethical
                            hacking is not illegal, and it is one of the demanding jobs available in the IT industry.
                            There are numerous companies that hire ethical hackers for penetration testing and
                            vulnerability assessments.</p>


                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> 2️⃣<b> Black Hat Hackers</b></p>
                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> Black Hat hackers, also known as crackers, are those who
                            hack in order to gain unauthorized access to a system and harm its operations or steal
                            sensitive information.</p>
                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> Black Hat hacking is always illegal because of its bad
                            intent which includes stealing corporate data, violating privacy, damaging the system,
                            blocking network communication, etc.</p>


                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> 3️⃣ <b>Grey Hat Hackers</b></p>
                        <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> Grey hat hackers are a blend of both black hat and white
                            hat hackers. They act without malicious intent but for their fun, they exploit a security
                            weakness in a computer system or network without the owner’s permission or knowledge.
                            Their intent is to bring the weakness to the attention of the owners and getting
                            appreciation or a little bounty from the owners.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the
                        different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is
                        defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and
                        steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses
                        in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal
                        advantage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled
                        user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS
                        created by Linus Torvalds.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a
                        password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux
                        is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking,
                        nothing is 100% secured.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the
                        Windows system.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">
                        Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
                        In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take
                        advantage of it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the
                        Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access.
                        Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you
                        can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks
                        and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use
                        social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing
                        password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the
                        computer.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">The lines between social engineering and phishing are blurred
                        because they usually go hand-in-hand in a sophisticated attack. Social engineering usually
                        involves masquerading as a legitimate employee (e.g., the CFO or CEO) or tricking an employee
                        into thinking that the attacker is a legitimate customer in an effort to get the employee to
                        provide the attacker with sensitive information or change account features (e.g., SIM swapping).
                    </p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">
                        Regardless of the attacker’s goals, there are some clear signs that communication is from social
                        engineering. One primary component in social engineering is playing on a targeted user’s fears
                        and emotions. The attacker doesn’t want the targeted user digesting and contemplating the
                        request, so social engineering involves using fear and a sense of urgency.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> The overall technique used in social engineering is using
                        emotions to trick users, but attackers use several standard methods to push the user into
                        performing an action (e.g., sending money to a bank account) and making the attack look more
                        legitimate. Usually, the techniques involve email or text messages, because they can be used
                        without voice conversations.</p>


                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Techniques</p>

      
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ Phishing: With social engineering, an attacker usually
                        pretends to be a corporate executive to trick users into sending money to an offshore bank
                        account.</p>
                    
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ Vishing and smishing: Attackers use text messages and
                        voice-changing software to send SMS messages or robo-call users. The messages usually promise
                        gifts or services in exchange for payment. These types of scams are called vishing (voice
                        phishing) and smishing (SMS phishing).</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ Baiting: It’s common for attackers to promise prizes or
                        money in exchange for a small payment. The offer is usually too good to be true, and the payment
                        is usually for shipping or some other cost coverage.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ Tailgating or piggybacking: Corporations that use security
                        scanners to block unauthorized access to the premises. An attacker uses tailgating or
                        piggybacking to trick users into using their own access cards to give the attacker physical
                        access to the premises.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ Quid pro quo: Disgruntled employees could be tricked into
                        providing sensitive information to an attacker in exchange for money or other promises.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Google hacking, sometimes, referred to as Google dorking, is
                        an information gathering technique used by an attacker leveraging advanced Google searching
                        techniques. Google hacking search queries can be used to identify security vulnerabilities in
                        web applications, gather information for arbitrary or individual targets, discover error
                        messages disclosing sensitive information, discover files containing credentials and other
                        sensitive data.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">
                        The advanced search string crafted by an attacker could be searching for the vulnerable version
                        of a web application, or a specific file-type (.pwd, .sql...) in order to further restrict the
                        search. The search can also be restricted to pages on a specific site, or it can search for
                        specific information across all websites, giving a list of sites that contain the information.
                    </p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">For instance, the following search query will list SQL files
                        (filetype:sql) available that have been indexed by Google on websites where directory listing is
                        enabled (intitle:"index of").</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Information gathering, also known as reconnaissance or footprinting, is the process of collecting information about a target system, network, or organization. This can be done for a variety of purposes, such as conducting a vulnerability assessment, preparing for a cyber attack, or developing a security plan.

                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> There are several methods that can be used for information gathering, including:</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> 1. Search engines: Using search engines such as Google to find publicly available information about a target, such as websites, social media profiles, and news articles.
<br><br>
                        2. WHOIS: Using the WHOIS database to find information about the ownership and registration of domain names.
                        <br><br>
                        3. Network scanning: Using tools such as nmap to scan a network for open ports and services, which can provide information about the network infrastructure and potentially vulnerable systems.
                        <br><br>
                        4. Social engineering: Using tactics such as phishing or pretexting to gather information from employees or other individuals within an organization.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> Overall, information gathering is an important part of cyber security, as it helps to identify potential vulnerabilities and develop a plan to protect against cyber threats.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Since security and compliance are high priorities for most
                        organizations, attacks on an organization’s computer systems take many different forms such as
                        spoofing, smurfing, and other types of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. These attacks are
                        designed to harm or interrupt the use of operational systems.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> System hacking is one of the most important steps that is
                        performed after acquiring information through the above techniques. This information can be used
                        to hack the target system using various hacking techniques and strategies.
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> System hacking helps to identify vulnerabilities and security
                        flaws in the target system and predict the effectiveness of additional security measures in
                        strengthening and protecting information resources and systems from attack.</p>

                    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">There are four steps in the system hacking:</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">1️⃣ Gaining Access: Use techniques such as cracking passwords
                        and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">2️⃣ Escalating Privileges: Exploit known vulnerabilities
                        existing in OSes and software applications to escalate privileges</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">3️⃣ Maintaining Access: Maintain high levels of access to
                        perform malicious activities such as executing malicious applications and stealing, hiding, or
                        tampering with sensitive system files</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">4️⃣ Clearing Logs: Avoid recognition by legitimate system
                        users and remain undetected by wiping out the entries corresponding to malicious activities in
                        the system logs, thus avoiding detection.</p>
