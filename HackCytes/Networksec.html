                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Domain Name System (DNS) is a system that is used to translate human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. DNS is an essential part of the internet, as it allows users to access websites and other online resources using easy-to-remember domain names, rather than having to remember long strings of numbers (IP addresses).</p>
                    
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">DNS works by storing records of domain names and their corresponding IP addresses in a distributed database known as the DNS namespace. When a user types a domain name into their web browser, their computer sends a request to a DNS server to look up the corresponding IP address. The DNS server then returns the IP address to the user's computer, which uses it to establish a connection to the desired website or online resource.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">DNS is a decentralized system, which means that there are many DNS servers around the world that work together to provide users with access to websites and other online resources. This helps to ensure that the internet is fast and reliable, as users can access DNS servers that are located close to them.

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ A security switch is a hardware device designed to protect
                        computers, laptops, smartphones and similar devices from unauthorized access or operation,
                        distinct from a virtual security switch which offers software protection. </p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ Security switches should be operated by an authorized user
                        only; for this reason, it should be isolated from other devices in order to prevent unauthorized
                        access and it should not be possible to bypass it, in order to prevent malicious manipulation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ The primary purpose of a security switch is to provide
                        protection against surveillance, eavesdropping, malware, spyware, and theft of digital devices.
                        Unlike other protections or techniques, a security switch can provide protection even if
                        security has already been breached, since it does not have any access from other components and
                        is not accessible by software. It can additionally disconnect or block peripheral devices, and
                        perform "man in the middle" operations</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">2️⃣ Router</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ A router is a device that connects two or more
                        packet-switched networks or subnetworks. </p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between
                        these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple
                        devices to use the same Internet connection.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">3️⃣ LAN</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ There are several types of routers, but most routers pass
                        data between LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide area networks). A LAN is a group of
                        connected devices restricted to a specific geographic area. A LAN usually requires a single
                        router.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">4️⃣ WAN</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ A WAN, by contrast, is a large network spread out over a
                        vast geographic area. Large organizations and companies that operate in multiple locations
                        across the country, for instance, will need separate LANs for each location, which then connect
                        to the other LANs to form a WAN. Because a WAN is distributed over a large area, it often
                        necessitates multiple routers and switches.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">A subnet, or subnetwork, is a segmented piece of a larger
                        network. More specifically, subnets are a logical partition of an IP network into multiple,
                        smaller network segments. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the method for sending data from one
                        computer to another over the internet. Each computer, or host, on the internet has at least one
                        IP address as a unique identifier.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Organizations will use a subnet to subdivide large networks
                        into smaller, more efficient subnetworks. One goal of a subnet is to split a large network into
                        a grouping of smaller, interconnected networks to help minimize traffic. This way, traffic
                        doesn't have to flow through unnecessary routs, increasing network speeds.</p>

                        3. Cloud firewalls: These firewalls are used to protect cloud-based resources and are typically managed by the cloud provider.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Firewalls can be configured to allow or block certain types of traffic based on various criteria, such as the source or destination of the traffic, the port number being used, or the type of traffic (e.g., HTTP or FTP). Firewalls are an important part of an overall security strategy, as they help to protect against cyber attacks and other threats.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a network security
                        tool (which can be a hardware device or software) that continuously monitors a network for
                        malicious activity and takes action to prevent it, including reporting, blocking, or dropping
                        it, when it does occur.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">It is more advanced than an intrusion detection system (IDS),
                        which simply detects malicious activity but cannot take action against it beyond alerting an
                        administrator. Intrusion prevention systems are sometimes included as part of a next-generation
                        firewall (NGFW) or unified threat management (UTM) solution.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Like many network security technologies, they must be powerful
                        enough to scan a high volume of traffic without slowing down network performance.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Endpoint security is the practice of securing endpoints or
                        entry points of end-user devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices from being
                        exploited by malicious actors and campaigns. Endpoint security systems protect these endpoints
                        on a network or in the cloud from cybersecurity threats. Endpoint security has evolved from
                        traditional antivirus software to providing comprehensive protection from sophisticated malware
                        and evolving zero-day threats.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Organizations of all sizes are at risk from nation-states,
                        hacktivists, organized crime, and malicious and accidental insider threats. Endpoint security is
                        often seen as cybersecurity's frontline, and represents one of the first places organizations
                        look to secure their enterprise networks.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">As the volume and sophistication of cybersecurity threats have
                        steadily grown, so has the need for more advanced endpoint security solutions. Today’s endpoint
                        protection systems are designed to quickly detect, analyze, block, and contain attacks in
                        progress. To do this, they need to collaborate with each other and with other security
                        technologies to give administrators visibility into advanced threats to speed detection and
                        remediation response times.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> A honeypot is a cybersecurity mechanism that uses a
                        manufactured attack target to lure cybercriminals away from legitimate targets. They also gather
                        intelligence about the identity, methods and motivations of adversaries.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> One honeypot definition comes from the world of espionage,
                        where Mata Hari-style spies who use a romantic relationship as a way to steal secrets are
                        described as setting a ‘honey trap’ or ‘honeypot’. Often, an enemy spy is compromised by a honey
                        trap and then forced to hand over everything he/she knows.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> In computer security terms, a cyber honeypot works in a
                        similar way, baiting a trap for hackers. It's a sacrificial computer system that’s intended to
                        attract cyberattacks, like a decoy. It mimics a target for hackers, and uses their intrusion
                        attempts to gain information about cybercriminals and the way they are operating or to distract
                        them from other targets.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Simple ‘if’ statement :- In a simple ‘if’ statement, a

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Malware is a harmful software that pretends to be a legitimate
                        program to infiltrate the computer. It is installed in different ways, but the most common are a
                        phishing email, fake installer, infected attachment, and phishing links.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Hackers make malware presentable to convince users into
                        installing them. Often, the users are unaware that the program is malware because it looks
                        legitimate. Basically, that’s how malware gets installed on the computer.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Once installed, malware hides in different folders in the
                        computer. If it’s an advanced type of malware, it can directly access the operating system. Then
                        it starts to encrypt files and record personal information.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Malware detection is the process of scanning the computer and
                        files to detect malware. It is effective at detecting malware because it involves multiple tools
                        and approaches. It’s not a one-way process, it’s actually quite complex. The good thing is
                        malware detection and removal take less than 50 seconds only.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">There are three main methods used to malware detection:
                        Signature based, Behavioural based and Heuristic ones.</p>

                        actually they are very complex in their working. There are many protocols and technologies
                        working behind to provide a stable connection to users. Data packets traveling through wire
                        provide a sense of security to users as data traveling through wire probably not heard by
                        eavesdroppers.</p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">To secure the wireless connection, we should focus on the
                        following areas –</p>
                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">• Identify endpoint of wireless network and end-users i.e.,

                    </p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> We know that wireless clients form an association with Access
                        Points (AP) and transmit data back and forth over the air. As long as all wireless devices
                        follow 802.11 standards, they all coexist. But all wireless devices are not friendly and
                        trustworthy, some rogue devices may be a threat to wireless security. Rogue devices can steal
                        our important data or can cause the unavailability of the network.</p>

                        authorize, and audit access to applications and IT systems. Often delivered as a component of an
                        identity and access management (IAM) solution, access management solutions help strengthen
                        security and reduce risk by tightly controlling access to on-premises and cloud-based
                        applications, services, and IT infrastructure. They help ensure the right users have access to
                        the right resources at the right times for the right reasons. </p>

                    <p class="w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Most access management solutions include tools for
