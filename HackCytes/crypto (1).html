<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Cryptography is the process of hiding or coding information so that only the person a message was intended for can read it. The art of cryptography has been used to code messages for thousands of years and continues to be used in bank cards, computer passwords, and ecommerce.</p>
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> Modern cryptography techniques include algorithms and ciphers that enable the encryption and decryption of information, such as 128-bit and 256-bit encryption keys. Modern ciphers, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), are considered virtually unbreakable. </p>
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> A common cryptography definition is the practice of coding information to ensure only the person that a message was written for can read and process the information. This cybersecurity practice, also known as cryptology, combines various disciplines like computer science, engineering, and mathematics to create complex codes that hide the true meaning of a message. Cryptography uses algorithms and mathematical concepts to transform messages into difficult-to-decipher codes through techniques like cryptographic keys and digital signing to protect data privacy, credit card transactions, email, and web browsing.</p>

<h3  class = "w3-text-dark-grey w3-padding-16"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Types of Cryptographic Algorithms</h3>
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">There are many types of cryptographic algorithms available. They vary in complexity and security, depending on the type of communication and the sensitivity of the information being shared. </p>

<ul>
<li class = "w3-text-dark-grey">Secret Key Cryptography : Secret key cryptography, also known as symmetric encryption, uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt a message. The sender encrypts the plaintext message using the key and sends it to the recipient who then uses the same key to decrypt it and unlock the original plaintext message.</li>

<li class = "w3-text-dark-grey">Stream Ciphers : Stream ciphers work on a single bit or byte at any time and constantly change the key using feedback mechanisms. A self-synchronizing stream cipher ensures the decryption process stays in sync with the encryption process by recognizing where it sits in the bit keystream. A synchronous stream cipher generates the keystream independently of the message stream and generates the same keystream function at both the sender and the receiver.
</li>
<li class = "w3-text-dark-grey">Block Ciphers : Block ciphers encrypt one block of fixed-size data at a time. It will always encrypt a plaintext data block to the same ciphertext when the same key is used. A good example of this is the Feistel cipher, which uses elements of key expansion, permutation, and substitution to create vast confusion and diffusion in the cipher. 
    The stages of encryption and decryption are similar if not identical, which means reversing the key reduces the code size and circuitry required for implementing the cipher in a piece of software or hardware.
</li>
<li class = "w3-text-dark-grey">Public Key Cryptography : Public key cryptography (PKC), or asymmetric cryptography, uses mathematical functions to create codes that are exceptionally difficult to crack. It enables people to communicate securely over a nonsecure communications channel without the need for a secret key. For example, proxy reencryption enables a proxy entity to reencrypt data from one public key to another without requiring access to the plaintext or private keys.

<hr><hr>
<p class = "w3-large ">A monoalphabetic substitution cipher, also known as a simple substitution cipher, relies on a fixed replacement structure. That is, the substitution is fixed for each letter of the alphabet. Thus, if "a" is encrypted to "R", then every time we see the letter "a" in the plaintext, we replace it with the letter "R" in the ciphertext.</p>
<p class = "w3-large "> A simple example is where each letter is encrypted as the next letter in the alphabet: "a simple message" becomes "B TJNQMF NFTTBHF". In general, when performing a simple substitution manually, it is easiest to generate the ciphertext alphabet first, and encrypt by comparing this to the plaintext alphabet. The table below shows how one might choose to, and we will, lay them out for this example. </p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">For example, let us take a simple mathematical expression c = a + b. Here, the values of a, b, c are not known. To compute the value of c, different persons can give different values of a and b. As their values are not fixed, they are called variables.</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26. Often the simple scheme A = 0, B = 1, …, Z = 25 is used, but this is not an essential feature of the cipher. To encrypt a message, each block of n letters (considered as an n-component vector) is multiplied by an invertible n × n matrix, against modulus 26. To decrypt the message, each block is multiplied by the inverse of the matrix used for encryption.
The matrix used for encryption is the cipher key, and it should be chosen randomly from the set of invertible n × n matrices (modulo 26).</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Playfair cipher is an encryption algorithm to encrypt or encode a message. It is the same as a traditional cipher. The only difference is that it encrypts a digraph (a pair of two letters) instead of a single letter.
</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> It initially creates a key-table of 5*5 matrix. The matrix contains alphabets that act as the key for encryption of the plaintext. Note that any alphabet should not be repeated. Another point to note that there are 26 alphabets and we have only 25 blocks to put a letter inside it. Therefore, one letter is excess so, a letter will be omitted (usually J) from the matrix. Nevertheless, the plaintext contains J, then J is replaced by I. It means treat I and J as the same letter, accordingly.</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Since Playfair cipher encrypts the message digraph by digraph. Therefore, the Playfair cipher is an example of a digraph substitution cipher.</p>

<ol>
<li class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">First, split the plaintext into digraphs (pair of two letters). If the plaintext has the odd number of letters, append the letter Z at the end of the plaintext. It makes the plaintext of even For example, the plaintext MANGO has five letters.

<p class = "w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">Example</p> 
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">A simple example for a transposition cipher is columnar transposition cipher where each character in the plain text is written horizontally with specified alphabet width. The cipher is written vertically, which creates an entirely different cipher text.</p>

In our example, if the letters of the word ‘road’ is written alphabetically, then ‘a’ comes first, ‘d’ comes next, then ‘o’ and ‘r’ come. In other words, ‘a’ can be represented with ‘1’, ‘d’ with ‘2’, ‘o’ with ‘3’ and ‘r’ with ‘4’. So, the key ‘road’ now becomes 4312.</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">    Thus, while generating the ciphertext, the fourth column is read first, then the third, first and second columns are read respectively. So, the ciphertext now becomes</p>

<hr><hr>
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">The railfence cipher is an easy to apply transposition cipher that jumbles up the order of the letters of a message in a quick convenient way. It also has the security of a key to make it a little bit harder to break.
   
    
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> The Rail Fence cipher works by writing your message on alternate lines across the page, and then reading off each line in turn. For example, the plaintext "defend the east wall" is written as shown below, with all spaces removed.</p>
    Picture</p>  
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">The simplest Rail Fence Cipher, where each letter is written in a zigzag pattern across the page.
    The ciphertext is then read off by writing the top row first, followed by the bottom row, to get "DFNTEATALEEDHESWL".</p>


<p class = "w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">Encryption</p> 
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">To encrypt a message using the Rail Fence Cipher, you have to write your message in zigzag lines across the page, and then read off each row. Firstly, you need to have a key, which for this cipher is the number of rows you are going to have. You then start writing the letters of the plaintext diagonally down to the right until you reach the number of rows specified by the key. You then bounce back up diagonally until you hit the first row again. This continues until the end of the plaintext.</p>

<img style="background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 90%);transition: background-color 300ms;" src="img17.jpg" width="832" height="200">  

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Note that at the end of the message we have inserted two "X"s. These are called nulls, and act as placeholders. We do this to make the message fit neatly in to the grid (so that there are the same number of letters on the top row, as on the bottom row. Although not necessary, it makes the decryption process a lot easier if the message has this layout.</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> The ciphertext is read off row by row to get "DNETLEEDHESWLXFTAAX".</p>

<p class = "w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">Decryption</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> The decryption process for the Rail Fence Cipher involves reconstructing the diagonal grid used to encrypt the message. We start writing the message, but leaving a dash in place of the spaces yet to be occupied. Gradually, you can replace all the dashes with the corresponding letters, and read off the plaintext from the table.</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">  We start by making a grid with as many rows as the key is, and as many columns as the length of the ciphertext. We then place the first letter in the top left square, and dashes diagonally downwards where the letters will be. When we get back to the top row, we place the next letter in the ciphertext. Continue like this across the row, and start the next row when you reach the end.</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>&nbsp; For example, if you receive the ciphertext "TEKOOHRACIRMNREATANFTETYTGHH", encrypted with a key of 4, you start by placing the "T" in the first square. You then dash the diagonal down spaces until you get back to the top row, and place the "E" here. Continuing to fill the top row you get the pattern below.</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">A stream cipher is a method of encrypting text (to produce ciphertext) in which a cryptographic key and algorithm are applied to each binary digit in a data stream, one bit at a time.

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">There is a vast number of block ciphers schemes that are in use. Many of them are publically known. Most popular and prominent block ciphers are listed below.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Digital Encryption Standard (DES) − The popular block cipher of the 1990s. It is now considered as a ‘broken’ block cipher, due primarily to its small key size.</li>
        <li>Triple DES − It is a variant scheme based on repeated DES applications. It is still a respected block ciphers but inefficient compared to the new faster block ciphers available.</li>
        <li>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) − It is a relatively new block cipher based on the encryption algorithm Rijndael that won the AES design competition.</li>
        <li>IDEA − It is a sufficiently strong block cipher with a block size of 64 and a key size of 128 bits. A number of applications use IDEA encryption, including early versions of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) protocol. The use of IDEA scheme has a restricted adoption due to patent issues.</li>
        <li>Twofish − This scheme of block cipher uses block size of 128 bits and a key of variable length. It was one of the AES finalists. It is based on the earlier block cipher Blowfish with a block size of 64 bits.</li>
        <li>Serpent − A block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits, which was also an AES competition finalist. It is a slower but has more secure design than other block cipher.</li>

<hr><hr>
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">A steganography technique involves hiding sensitive information within an ordinary, non-secret file or message, so that it will not be detected. The sensitive information will then be extracted from the ordinary file or message at its destination, thus avoiding detection. Steganography is an additional step that can be used in conjunction with encryption in order to conceal or protect data.</p>

<p class = "w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">Different Types of Steganography</p> 
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">1. Text Steganography − There is steganography in text files, which entails secretly storing information. In this method, the hidden data is encoded into the letter of each word. </p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> 2. Image Steganography − The second type of steganography is image steganography, which entails concealing data by using an image of a different object as a cover. Pixel intensities are the key to data concealment in image steganography.</p>

<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">Since the computer description of an image contains multiple bits, images are frequently used as a cover source in digital steganography. </p> 


<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">3. Audio Steganography − It is the science of hiding data in sound. Used digitally, it protects against unauthorized reproduction. Watermarking is a technique that encrypts one piece of data (the message) within another (the "carrier"). Its typical uses involve media playback, primarily audio clips.</p>


<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey"> 4. Video Steganography − Video steganography is a method of secretly embedding data or other files within a video file on a computer. Video (a collection of still images) can function as the "carrier" in this scheme. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) is commonly used to insert values that can be used to hide the data in each image in the video, which is undetectable to the naked eye. Video steganography typically employs the following file formats: H.264, MP4, MPEG, and AVI.
</p>
 <p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">  5. Network or Protocol Steganography − It involves concealing data by using a network protocol like TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP, etc., as a cover object. Steganography can be used in the case of covert channels, which occur in the OSI layer network model.</p>


 <p class = "w3-xlarge w3-text-dark-grey">Steganography Examples Include</p> 
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ Writing with invisible ink</p>
<p class = "w3-large w3-text-dark-grey">➡ Embedding text in a picture (like an artist hiding their initials in a painting they’ve done </p>
